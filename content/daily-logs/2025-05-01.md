## 🛠 Summary

CIM experienced downtime this morning due to conflicting Python processes caused by overlapping manual and automatic startup scripts.

---

## 📅 Timeline

- **9:00 AM – 9:12 AM**: Initial CIM downtime noticed.
- **9:12 AM – 9:30 AM**: Repeated crashing and restarting occurred.
- **9:30 AM onwards**: Identified and resolved issue.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

After Josh restarted the VM, both the **auto-start script** (with a 60-second delay) and a **manual startup** were triggered. This led to **two Python processes** (running Waitress) trying to bind to the same port (`8001`), causing the server to crash intermittently.

---

## 🧪 Debugging Steps

1. **Checked Nginx Logs**: Found 443 access forbidden, but config looked fine.
2. **Verified Redis**: Redis was running without issues.
3. **Tried Localhost Access**: `http://localhost:8001` failed to load → pointed to Waitress issue.
4. **Ran `netstat` on port 8001**: Discovered **two active `python.exe`** processes.
5. **Killed Both Processes**.
6. **Restarted Services**: Successfully restored CIM with a single instance.

## ⚠️ Additional Notes

- **April 2025 Windows Update** changed some services from **manual to auto-start**, including some that **reserve port 443**.
- We had previously disabled these, but we will **verify our changes again at 5:30 PM** to ensure they hold across reboots.

## ✅ Action Items

- [x] Kill conflicting processes and restart CIM.
- [x] Verify Nginx and Redis status.
- [ ] Confirm Windows service changes persist at 5:30 PM test.
